            <h2>2. Why We Collect Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Provide Services:</strong> Your personal and service data is required to activate new

                <li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> We use your contact and service data to provide technical support
                    and resolve any issues.</li>

                    including our execution charges, which are clearly disclosed on our website and range from $49.99 to
                    $199.99.</li>
                <li><strong>Improvement and Marketing:</strong> With your consent, we use non-identifying data to
                    improve our services, assess site traffic, and offer promotions aligned with your preferences. We
                    ensure that any data collected is transparent, and we fully comply with Google’s guidelines by not
                    misrepresenting any element of our services or the fees associated with them.</li>

                    agreement with the provider.</li>

                transparent to the user before they make a commitment.</p>
