            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>

            <p>Welcome to Net Upgrader. These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of our website, services,
                and all related interactions between you and Net Upgrader. By accessing our website or utilizing our
                services, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms. Please read them carefully before
                proceeding.</p>
            <p><strong>If you do not agree with any of the Terms outlined below, please do not use our services or this
                    website.</strong></p>

            <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Net Upgrader":</strong> Refers to our company, an authorized dealer providing intermediary
                    services between consumers and third-party service providers, including but not limited to internet,
                    cellular, streaming, and bundled services.</li>
                <li><strong>"User", "you", or "your":</strong> Refers to any person or entity accessing our website or
                    using our services.</li>
                <li><strong>"Services":</strong> Refers to any support or execution services provided by Net Upgrader,
                    including but not limited to setting up new connections, plan upgrades, account cancellations, bill
                    payments, and related support.</li>
                <li><strong>"Third-Party Service Providers":</strong> Refers to external companies and service providers
                    with whom Net Upgrader has partnerships to offer their services to customers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Scope of Services</h2>
            <p>Net Upgrader offers execution services on behalf of third-party service providers. We assist in tasks
                such as new connection setup, billing assistance, account upgrades, and other support-related
                activities. While Net Upgrader facilitates these services, the actual delivery of internet, streaming,
                or cellular services is provided by third-party service providers.</p>
            <p>Net Upgrader is not responsible for the quality, uptime, or reliability of the services delivered by
                third-party service providers. All service-related issues, outages, or quality concerns should be
                addressed directly with the relevant service provider.</p>

            <h2>3. Account Responsibilities</h2>
            <p><strong>Account Security:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
                account credentials and for all activities conducted under your account. Net Upgrader will not be liable
                for any losses resulting from unauthorized use of your account.</p>
            <p><strong>Accurate Information:</strong> You agree to provide correct and up-to-date information, including
                your billing and contact details. Providing false or incorrect information may result in the suspension
                or termination of your account.</p>

            <h2>4. Payments and Fees</h2>
            <p><strong>Execution Fees:</strong> Net Upgrader charges execution fees for administrative services it
                provides, such as connection setup, plan changes, and account management. These fees will be disclosed
                before you confirm a service request.</p>
            <p><strong>Third-Party Billing:</strong> Charges billed by third-party service providers are outside of Net
                Upgrader’s control, and must be paid directly to the provider according to their billing terms.</p>

            <h2>5. Service Requests</h2>
            <p><strong>Service Execution:</strong> Net Upgrader will make reasonable efforts to ensure timely execution
                of service requests. However, completion may depend on third-party provider timelines.</p>
            <p><strong>Cancellations:</strong> You must notify us immediately to cancel a request. Cancellations may
                only be accepted if the request has not yet been processed. Refer to our Refund Policy for more details.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Limitations of Liability</h2>

                    disruptions or quality issues from third-party providers.</li>

                    content on our website is error-free.</li>
                <li><strong>Service Delays:</strong> Net Upgrader is not liable for delays caused by technical issues,
                    third-party schedules, or force majeure events.</li>
